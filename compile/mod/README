To create support for a new module type, I've been doing the following:

1) Create a new subdirectory with the module name (exactly!) in the 'compile/mod/' directory

2) Copy the 'view.php' file from the original module to the new subdirectory, renaming the file to 'compile.php'

3) Modify the new compile.php file, so that it displays the content of the module as desired.  Specifically:
	- Do NOT call the 'header' function, because it displays the header AND the navigation
	- Do NOT call the 'footer' function
	- Do not call the 'log' function, as we've already logged that we're compiling the course.
	- Do NOT call any of the 'module completed' code, so that someone doesn't progress through the activity 
	  just because the compiled the course.  Compiling an activity should not count as completing it.
	- Do sanity check and consider, "Is this logical information to print out on paper?". ie. A link, 	
	  without showing the exact location, doesn't do a person reading a paper copy much good.

4) Enable the module type in admin settings page, if you haven't done so already.
