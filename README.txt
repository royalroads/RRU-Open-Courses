Description of the plugin:

In Moodle 2, when a course is ready to be made available for students, an instructor or other staff member must manually make the course visible.  In a large institutional environment with many course offerings starting on varying dates and running concurrently, the process of identifying which courses should be made visible and then opening the courses to students can be tedious and error-prone.  

Although Moodle supports course start dates, there is no core functionality in Moodle to automatically make courses visible to students at the appropriate time.  

This plugin provides that functionality.
