Name: defaultcourses
Description: This custom local plugin allows an administrator to choose one or more courses that are considered “default” courses. All users in Moodle (apart from the Moodle site administrator and guest accounts) will be enroled as students in these selected course(s). The plugin takes advantage of the Moodle CRON to check for new users that need to be enroled in the default courses.
Moodle Version: 2.1.x
